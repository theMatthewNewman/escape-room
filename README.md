This is a single page application that functions as a escape-room style game allowing me to flex css and javascript.

## First idea create a lock that opens with a key.
 lock now can either shake or open depending on whether the person has the key activated.
 
 need to work on the key

 Next idea a keypad that requires a batery to turn on it you put in the right code it opens to reveal the key.

notification for the things that you have collected.

 Call mom note with a phone number on it. 202-555-0112
 => phone call gives info on battery
    "hey mom since your at the store can you pick me up some batteries?"
    "Hey Honey I just picked up those batteries you wanted. i left them in the drawer for you when I get back"
    => pay with penny
    => battery used to power diplay

penny in navbar
=> used to open the plate to put battery in (have to do this before phone call).

switch for switching between phone and display.
